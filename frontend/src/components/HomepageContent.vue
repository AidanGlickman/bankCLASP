                <p>BANKclasp is a football tool designed by five high school students. As part of completing a senior year capstone project, the developers 
                of bankCLASP created this tool which is designed to statistically compare a 
                college football prospect to current NFL players. This tool could benefit agents looking for easy ways 
                to find potential clients worth pursuing in the NCAA, teams looking to see how efficient their players are 
                or how they can best utilize their players, or fans simply looking for more information on a given prospect.</p>
